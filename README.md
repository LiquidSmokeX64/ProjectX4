# ProjectX4
An OpenDevelopmenet Mod for X4: Foundations
The idea here is to simply add new Equipment in a vanilla friendly way, and add some minor QoL changes.
These are to include Engines, Weapons, and Shields for Ships and Station Building.
Also altering Station Traders Wares to compensate for not being able to use Venture Platforms with Mods.
We add all (current) paint mods, weapon mod parts, and SETA parts to both regular Station Traders and Pirates.
Most common Xenon Wares found from combat are legalized for convenience of combat pilots.
Most common Mining Wares found by mining almost anywhere ie: Spacefly Eggs are legalized because they get picked up too often on accident.

We are not adding any art to the Ship Parts as it is not actually needed to function, everything is vanilla based, copied, renamed, and edited as needed.
